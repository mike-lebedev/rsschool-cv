### About me ###
I worked at a job I didn't like and in my spare time I got interested in programming. At that moment I met a girl and I wanted to make a website for her, she is a photographer. I found video tutorials on YouTube and wrote frontend from scratch. *I learned css and html on my own.* 
My strengths: 
* *I always do the job to the end if I enjoy it*
* *fast learner*
* *i love my sense of style*
* *I only do what I like*
